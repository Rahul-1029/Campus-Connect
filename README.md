🎓 Campus Connect
Empowering Students through Peer-to-Peer Resource Sharing
Built by Team Visionary Variables MVGR TechSprint 2024


📖 Project Overview
Campus Connect is a localized marketplace designed specifically for the MVGR student community. It facilitates the buying, selling, and gifting of academic essentials like textbooks, engineering tools (drafters, lab coats), and electronics.

Instead of letting expensive resources sit idle after a semester, students can list them for juniors to find easily, promoting sustainability and affordability on campus.


✨ Key Features
Real-time Marketplace: Browse live listings from fellow students powered by Google Firebase.

Secure Management: Sellers use a unique 4-digit PIN to manage and delete their listings, preventing unauthorized changes.

One-Click Communication: Direct WhatsApp integration allows buyers to message sellers instantly with pre-filled item details.

Optimized Web Experience: Custom-built Flutter web interface optimized for mobile and desktop browsers with fast-loading HTML rendering.

Branded Experience: Designed with a clean Material 3 UI utilizing the official GDG color palette.


🛠️ Technical Stack
Frontend: Flutter (Web)

Backend: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL Database)

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

Language: Dart

Integration: WhatsApp Business API (URL Launching)


🚀 How It Works
List an Item: Enter your name, item details, price, and a contact number. Create a Secret PIN.

Browse: View the feed of available resources.

Connect: Click "Contact" to open a WhatsApp chat directly with the seller.

Complete & Clean: Once the item is sold, the seller enters their PIN to remove the post, keeping the feed fresh.


🏗️ Future Scope
Internal Chat: Moving from WhatsApp to an in-app real-time chat system.

Category Filtering: Adding tags like "Books," "Electronics," and "Lab Kits."

Location Tracking: Specifying which block or hostel the item is located in.

Authentication: Transitioning from PINs to MVGR Student Email (Single Sign-On).
